<li>&nbsp;We saw that the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm, the simple distributed feedback control algorithm used in almost all congestion control algorithms today, has some key strengths such as simultaneously optimizing fairness and eÙè∞åciency. De- spite inheriting those strengths from AIMD, TCP‚Äôs congestion control algorithm is not ideal for datacenters and we saw in the Jupiter paper that even for lightly loaded datacenters, managing congestion is still a big open research challenge.
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;Give a few (at least three) reasons why TCP is not eÙè∞Ñective for managing congestion in datacenters.</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Describe at least one remedy in the context of datacenters for improving the performance of TCP.</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;Is this remedy consistent with, at odds with, or orthogonal to the end-to-end principle?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Suppose we build a cluster with a fat tree topology using 24-port switches, following the topology design of the Al-Fares paper (that you read and reviewed).
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;How many distinct end-to-end shortest paths are there in the physical topology between a source server A and a destination server B in a diÙè∞Ñerent pod? (Here, shortest paths are those that have the minimum number of switches along the path. This question concerns the physical topology, not routing or forwarding.)</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Suppose the cluster runs BGP, with each switch having its own AS number and each edge switch announcing a distinct attached IP preÙè∞Öx covering all its servers. (No other preÙè∞Öxes are announced.) Switches run standard IP forwarding with ECMP across all shortest paths. How many forwarding rules are in each edge switch? How many are in each core switch? (Each forwarding rule speciÙè∞Öes a single egress interface for a set of matching packets.)</li>

(c) Suppose the switch hardware is capable of performing MPLS forwarding, with IP-in- MPLS encapsulation, and the hardware can also still perform IP forwarding. More speciÙè∞Öcally, a forwarding rule on a switch can either (1) perform IP/ECMP forwarding as above, (2) match a preÙè∞Öx of IP packets and direct it into an MPLS tunnel, with ECMP-style hashing if there are multiple matching rules; (3) perform MPLS label swap forwarding; or (4) match an MPLS label, pop the MPLS header and continue forwarding out an interface via IP. Can you use this hardware to deliver data along the same paths as ECMP, but with fewer forwarding rules? If so, describe your solution and how many forwarding rules it needs at each edge switch and at each core switch.

(d) Compare the resilience of your solution with that of ECMP. SpeciÙè∞Öcally, suppose one core switch fails. What plausibly happens within about 1 millisecond, i.e., with only local reaction at each switch, in ECMP and in your solution? (Note: the goal isn‚Äôt to produce a scheme which is necessarily better or worse than ECMP; the goal is just to compare.)

<ol start="3">
<li>&nbsp;Routes between A and B are asymmetric when the A Ùè∞ç B path is not the same as the B Ùè∞ç A path. How can asymmetric routing occur (a) inside a datacenter with a topology such as fat-tree that uses ECMP, and (b) between two datacenters even if all networks use BGP with common business relationship policies (prefer customer over peer over provider for route selection, and valley-free export)? Give two examples (one for (a) and one for (b)) of how this could happen.</li>
<li>&nbsp;BGP routing can be formulated as a game where the selÙè∞Ösh players are au- tonomous systems (ASes). It can be shown that this game has no Nash equilibrium (stable state) in some cases. That is, the control plane will keep switching routes even though the physical network is stable. In this problem, we‚Äôll see an example where there are two equilibria, and diÙè∞Ñerent sequences of events could lead to one or the other.Consider the network below:
For simplicity, assume AS 1 is the only destination: it is the only AS that will originate an announcement message. The ASes have provider/customer/peer business relationships as shown. They follow the common route selection and export policies ‚Ä¶ except that AS 1 is using AS 2 as a backup provider. This means AS 1 has instructed AS 2 to route to AS 1 via the link 2 ‚Üí 1 only when no other path is available. (Incidentally, this is possible with BGP‚Äôs community attribute.) The eÙè∞Ñect is that AS 2 prefers to route through AS 3 in order to reach AS 1. Assume that at time 0, no routes have been announced by anyone. Shortly after time 0, AS 1 will begin announcing its IP preÙè∞Öx.

<li>(b) &nbsp;Describe a diÙè∞Ñerent sequence of events that lead to a diÙè∞Ñerent stable state.</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;Suppose the network is now stabilized in state (a). A link fails; the BGP routers re- converge; the link recovers; BGP reconverges again; but now the network is in state (b) instead of state (a)!

<ol start="5">
<li>&nbsp;Short questions.
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;In the original OpenFlow paper that we read, a centralized controller receives the Ùè∞Örst packet of each Ùè∞ãow and installs forwarding rules to handle that Ùè∞ãow. However, a sig- niÙè∞Öcant concern for any centralized design is scalability. Describe a feature of Google‚Äôs Firepath SDN design that allows it to scale to large datacenters.</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Consider a cluster of database servers. The time taken for any server to respond to any request is 10 milliseconds 99.8% of the time, and 200 milliseconds 0.2% of the time. Assume these times are sampled independently at random for each request. We have a front end web server that, when a user request arrives, queries 100 database servers in parallel. When all responses are received, it can reply to the client. The web server itself is incredibly fast, so all its local processing always takes less than 1 millisecond. What is the probability that the web server needs ‚â• 200 milliseconds to be ready to reply to the client? (As with all answers, brieÙè∞ãy show how you calculated the answer.)</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;In the setting of the previous question, suppose the web server needs to perform two phases of processing before replying to the client. Phase 1 queries 100 database servers as described above. But now, after receiving all responses from phase 1, it can begin the second phase, where it queries another 200 database servers in parallel. Finally, when all responses are received, it can reply to the client. What is the probability that the web server needs to wait ‚â• 200 milliseconds for its requests to complete?</li>
</ol>

<li>[15 points] In a regular Clos datacenter, among the four types of resources (compute, memory, storage, and network), which ones are likely to become scalability bottlenecks for MapReduce and Spark? You will need to explain the workÙè∞ãows of these systems to answer this question.</li>
<li>[25 points] Peer-validation: One of the Ùè∞Önal tasks for the project is to evaluate a peer project. As you read the Ùè∞Önal reports, we need you to validate and comment on the repro- ducibility of the graphs in it. You will practice validating a project for this assignment using the Checkpoint 2 slides of a group assigned to you. The group-validator assignments will be posted on Piazza after the deadline of the second checkpoint.
<ul>
<li>Write a brief summary (1 paragraph) of the project assigned to you: What problem are they going to solve? Why is it important? Their approach? Their progress so far?</li>
<li>Write a comment or question for that project.</li>
<li>Please use the following rubric to leave a score on the reproducibility of their results. Note that this is not their Ùè∞Önal grade. The teaching staÙè∞Ñ will be evaluating the projects and reproduce the results separately. This is just to give us another perspective and practice peer-validation.</li>

‚Ä¢ [Optional] Feel free to write some additional feedback in addition to the reproducibility score. We will also appreciate if you can comment on the quality of analysis and if you thought it was interesting.

8. [5 points] Optional/Extra credit. One of the reasons that MapReduce is slow is the barrier between the Map and the Reduce phases, i.e., no Reduce task can start before all Map tasks Ùè∞Önish. Suppose a programmer writes a variant of MapReduce without a barrier, i.e., where Reduces can start before all Maps are done computing.

‚Ä¢ Demonstrate with an example that this Mapreduce run may be incorrect, e.g., it may generate an incorrect value.

‚Ä¢ Show how you can resolve this correctness issue while (partially) preserving the perfor- mance improvement of this Ùè∞âbarrier-lessÙè∞ä MapReduce.
